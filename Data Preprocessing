# Data download & data preprocessing

## To download the data:
- Go to the [data section of "Clustering BioTrove competition page on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/biotrove-clustering/data)
- Click "Download All"
- Store files somewhere locally on your system

## Data preprocessing

The data preprocessing notebook handles all preprocessing steps for the BioTrove dataset.

### What this notebook does
- Loads BioTrove images and metadata
- Performs image transforms
- Defines a custom PyTorch Dataset
- Creates DataLoader

### How this fits in the workflow
This preprocessing step is shared across all four feature extraction methods. 
All you need to do is **add your unique image directory filepath AND metadata csv filepath** to the top of the preprocessing notebook.
